The purpose of this Git repo is to exhibit the skills I have
developed as a web programmer during my time in the Spring of 2015 section of
Web Programming. This repo includes basic HTML5/CSS assignments, JavaScript,
node.js, MongoDB, AJAX, and more. This repo shows my progress in developing
fundamental web programming skills that will ultimately serve as a foundation
for future web development projects I choose to pursue.

My favorite assignment was the server assignment, in which I wrote used
node.js, JavaScript, and MongoDB to save and send data that could be linked
with my implementation of the Maurader's Map (used Google API to display
names and locations on a google map). I really enjoyed getting experience
with both sides of web programming and familiarizing myself with backend
development. 

I have grown a lot from this course. At the beginning of this course, I had
very little experience with web programming. I am coming out of this course
confident in my HTML5/CSS and JavasScript skills and believe my foundation will
allow me to further pursue projects in these languages. The core concepts behind
this course, such as higher order functions, will help when I explore
writing web programs in different languages. I also had no knowledge of
backend development and was not familiar with using databases but now have
solid foundational skills in these areas. Not only have I grown from simply
learning new skills, but I have also grown in that I now understand the
concepts necessarily to promote further exploration of web programming.

The most important thing I have learned from this class is never trust
user input. From the assignment on security, I saw how susceptible my
code is to being broken or hacked. For example, learning about XSS opened my
eyes to a world of vulnerabilities that I had not considered when first
working with backend development. This has made me a more defensive programmer
and taught me to always think ahead of a client who is looking for vulnerabilities
in my code. Another example is exposing myself to the numerous tools used to send
harmful data to a server, such as Tamper Data. But even a bad curl request can
break a server, which again reinforced the importance of thinking ahead of
the client.

I would like to delve deeper into backend development. I am really interested
in working with databases beyond MongoDB. I also want to experiment beyond
JavaScript/node.js for backend development. I'm looking forward to learning about
advantages and disadvantages of various web development methadologies.
