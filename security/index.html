    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> For this assignment, I was to expose security and privacy issues
        in a classmate's assignments 3 and 4 for Comp 20. </p>
    <h1> Methadology </h1>
    <p> I started using a blackbox approach by doing curl requests. I exclusively
        used curl for POST requests. I used XSS first to disrupt the HTML
        page rendering, then to add data into the collection that sent an
        alert as the login rather than valid text. Lastly, I used curl to
        expose problems with data input into the db collection. </p>
    <h1> Abstract of Findings </h1>
    <p> All of the problems from my curl posts came stemmed from putting too much
        - or any - faith in client input. When making a server or site secure,
        it is important to consider the worst inputs a client can send your
        server or site in order to ensure security and privacy. It is important
        to have strict constraints on what is expected of user input, which
        prevents harmful or useless client input from being stored. Ultimately,
        it's about predicting what could go wrong and taking precautionary
        measures to adjust. </p>
    <h1> Issues Found </h1>
    <h2> Issue: XSS </h2>
    <p> Location: GET API for HTML page </p>
    <p> Severity: High because it prevents future data entires from being
    displayed, creating a major inconsistency between the data being stored
    and the data that the client will believe is stored </p>
    <p> Description: Data submitted that includes a script that injects html to
    alter the server's page is not caught. Because of this, it is possible
    to break the page not only by altering the page itself but also preventing
    other data inputs from rendering on the page after being posted. </p>
    </div>
    <img src="curl_request_html.jpg"/>
    <p> This was the curl request sent to /sendLocation which injects an HTML
        style tag into the homepage</p>
    <img src="changed_html_style.jpg"/>
    <p> As a result, the background color was changed. While this was a relatively
        innocuous change, this indicates that this server is susceptible to more
        harmful scripts that can alter its GET API. </p>
    </div>
    <p> Resolution: This issue can be resolved by checking user input and rejecting
    invalid or scripted input. </p>

    <h2> Issue: Invalid data input</h2>
    <p> Location: POST API in /sendLocation </p>
    <p> Severity: Medium because it does not break the server but just does
        not render a position on a map that has been given bad data instead of
        issuing an error message and not storing the data in the collection. </p>
    <p> Description: When sending a curl post request with an invalid lat&lng, the
        server does not issue an error message but instead saves the invalid
        location in the database; however, this creates an inconsistency because
        while that entry will appear in the database and presumably the main
        GET page, that entry will never render on the map. </p>
    <img src="invalid_lat_lng.jpg"/>
    <p> This screenshot shows that after inputting an invalid lat and lng, this
        entry is erroneously stored in the locations database.
    <p> Resolution: Simply check in the /sendLocation that the lat and lng entered
        are valid. If not, set the response to an erorr. </p>
